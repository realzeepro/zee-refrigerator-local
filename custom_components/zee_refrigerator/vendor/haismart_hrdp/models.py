# These codes come from a Haier-WIDE space, not a per-model allocation. The tell is the gaps: a
# cooling-only model lists operationMode 0/1/2 and then jumps to 6 for fan-only, skipping 3/4/5. If
# each model numbered its own modes they would be contiguous. So the right way to read a digital
# model is "which of the global codes does this unit declare", not "what do its descriptions say".
#
# Only codes seen in real digital models are listed. operationMode 3 and 5 are deliberately ABSENT:
# they exist in the space but nothing here has observed them, and an unmapped code is dropped with a
# log line rather than guessed (a mode we cannot name simply doesn't appear in the entity).
