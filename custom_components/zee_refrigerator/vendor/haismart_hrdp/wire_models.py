"""Per-family EPP wire models — the positional attribute map for status reports whose layout is
*not* the classic split-AC family that :func:`haismart_hrdp.uss.parse_full_status` decodes inline.

Background
----------
Every Haier AC packs its status attributes into a bit-field array of 16-bit big-endian words that
begins at byte 92 of the decrypted report (right after the ``6d 01`` getAllProperty response code).
*Where* each attribute sits in that array is the **wire model**, and it is a property of the model a
device reports itself as (its uPlusId) rather than of the device. The *digital* model we fetch per
device carries an attribute's valueRange and enums but no position, so these maps are transcribed
from the published per-model descriptions and validated field by field against real captured
reports. :mod:`haismart_hrdp.canonical_map` covers where those descriptions agree with each other,
which is nearly everywhere; this module covers the families and the exceptions.

What a "family" is
------------------
A family is a **distinct field map**, and one map can span several report lengths (the classic
split-AC family is described at report lengths 109/121/125 and appears on real hardware at 127 —
only its trailing word count differs). So report length alone is a *good but imperfect* key: among
AC split units each length maps to a single field map, but there is a genuine collision at 149 B (a
floor/heat-pump class we don't target). Selection therefore prefers an exact uPlusId match and
otherwise keys on report length **with a decode sanity-check** (see :meth:`WireModel.decode`),
degrading to the caller's unknown-layout path rather than mis-decoding.

The classic family stays in ``uss.py``
--------------------------------------
The classic 125/127-byte family keeps its existing hardware-verified decode + the grSetDAC **write**
path in ``uss.py`` untouched. This module adds decoding for other families, plus — for a family whose
group-set command its model fully specifies (``group_cmd`` + :attr:`WireModel.write_fields`)
— a **control encoder** built on that spec. That spec basis is the same one heat mode shipped on
(model-derived, method hardware-confirmed on other units); a family without a ``group_cmd`` stays
monitoring-only.

    """One attribute's position in the word array plus how to turn its raw bits into a value.

    ``word`` is 1-based (word 1 = bytes 92..93). ``bit`` is the LSB within the 16-bit big-endian
    word (bit 0 = least-significant).

    An attribute wider than the word that holds its LSB simply continues into the words **before**
    it: ``word``/``bit`` locate the least-significant end, and significance grows backwards through
    the array. The published map is written that way and only makes sense read that way — its
    32-bit cumulative counter puts its low half at the stated word and its high half one word
    earlier (both families carrying it agree), and its two 24-bit stamps, at word 7 bit 8 and word 8
    bit 0, tile words 6..8 exactly with no overlap backwards and collide forwards.

    ``kind`` selects the decode:

    * ``"bool"``  -> ``bool(raw)``
    * ``"int"``   -> ``raw * k + c`` (a temperature/number)
    * ``"temp"``  -> ``raw * k + c``, but ``None`` for a raw value that means "no such probe"
      (``0x00``/``0xFF``) or that lands outside :data:`_PLAUSIBLE_SENSOR_C`. Use this for a *sensor*
      reading rather than ``"int"``: a unit without an outdoor probe reports 0, which the raw formula
      would turn into a confident −64 °C, and one fabricated MEASUREMENT permanently skews the
      min/max/mean of a user's long-term statistics. This mirrors ``uss._sensor_temp`` on the classic
      family.
    * ``"raw"``   -> the field's integer value, unscaled: a code, or a reading that needs no
      scaling at all (a register already in watts). ``"int"`` would return the same number as a
      float, which is right for a scaled temperature and wrong for a whole-unit counter.
    * ``"counter"`` -> like ``"raw"``, but ``None`` for zero. A cumulative register that reads
      exactly 0 is one the firmware never populates rather than a unit that has used nothing —
      whole classes of these air conditioners carry the register and leave it at zero for their
      whole service life, and a total that is permanently 0 is worse than absent: it sits in the
      Energy dashboard reporting no consumption.
    * ``"enum"``  -> ``enum[raw]`` — translates the raw wire value into the code the device
      **publishes** for that attribute, or drops the field when the raw value isn't in the map. Most
      attributes number themselves the same way in both places and need no entry here; the few that
      do not are the reason this exists. The mapped-to value is a Haier STD code — a string where a
      per-model :class:`~haismart_hrdp.models.AttributeProfile` names it, an integer where the
      published map carries the translation itself.

# partial decode misfires on this model: byte 92 is the module's `volume`, not the setpoint, so the
# setpoint reads as 48 C and power reads as off (haismart-local issue #5).
#
# Transcribed from the published models for `02012036` (挂机通用_V2D18S_0D05, wall mounted) and its
# floor-standing sibling `0301200n` (柜机通用_V2D18S_0D05) — the only two that imply a 165-byte
# report, and their field maps are identical, so keying this family on report length is unambiguous.
# Validated against the two distinct reports captured on a
# real HSU-12KCROC(IN)-R32 (issue #5): power off/on matched the stated states, the setpoint decoded to
# the 22 C the reporter had set, indoor read 30.0/27.5 C, and vertical swing matched fixed/swinging.
#
# Deliberately omitted from the READ: indoorHumidity and the air-quality attributes (this class of
# unit has no such probes and every capture read 0), and `specialMode`. `outdoorTemperature` IS read,
# but as a ``"temp"`` field — both captures report the 0 sentinel, which surfaces as "no reading"
# rather than a fabricated −64 C.
#
# **175 B is the same map with five words on the end** (haismart-local issue #8, a Malaysian
# HS-25VRB03). Every field above sits at the same word, and the unit's own published attribute values
# agree with what this map decodes out of its report on ten of them — setpoint, mode, fan speed,
# power, screen light, self-clean, both vane POSITIONS (vertical 2, horizontal 5) and indoor
# temperature to within the half degree the two readings were taken apart. So the longer report is
# this family, not a new one, and the extra words are additional registers rather than a displacement.
#
# What those five carry, from the same comparison: an input-power register at word 41 (`acInput`,
# watts) and the published map's cumulative counter at words 34+35, mirrored at 39+40 — the unit
# publishes `accumulatedUseMainsPower` and `totalElectricityUsed` with one identical value, and both
# wire pairs read that number.
#
# **The counter is in watt-hours**, settled against a unit whose owner captured it in known states
# and read its own app's energy page at the same moment. Three measurements, on three timescales:
#
#   * The register accumulates in fixed intervals rather than continuously — the model publishes the
#     interval as `energySavePeriod`, 15 minutes on this unit. One whole interval spent cooling
#     added 347, i.e. 1388 W held for 15 minutes, against the 1224..1432 W its own power register
#     read across that same quarter hour.
#   * A 26-minute session at a measured ~1190 W average added 478, against 494 expected.
#   * Between a capture at 00:53 and one at 12:07, on a day whose usage began after the first, it
#     added 7516 — and the app reported 7.52 kWh for that day.
#
# So one count is one watt-hour to within the precision of the comparison, three times over, and the
# entity is published. It reads absent while the register is zero, which is the state our own units
# and the 165-byte reports are in — those carry the register and never populate it.

# it resolves a profile by **deviceType** (a prefix hierarchy -- the class model `02012` covers this
# whole class), and the class model's group-set needs no displacement at all.
#
# ★★ SETTLED, by one file that carries a report and a cloud record taken together. What had blocked
# these was a conflict with the READ map: `write_base_word + write_word - 1` is the report word a
# written bit reads back at, so the published write frame puts the vane at report w20, while this
# family's captures put it at w25. Both could not be right, and every capture then held read 0 at
# both, so nothing could choose. One could, and it had been on disc for a day:
#
#   | report                       | that same file's cloud record        |
#   | w20.b0 (map's vane)     = 0  | windDirectionVertical  = 2           |
#   | w25    (inserted block) = 2  | windDirectionVerticalL/R = 0 / 0     |
#   | w21.b8 (map's fan)      = 6  | windSpeed              = 1           |
#   | w26.b9 (inserted block) = 1  | windSpeedL/R           = 3 / 5       |
#
# That record is fresh, and provably so in its own file: its setpoint (22.0), indoor temperature
# (28.0), power and all six word-22 toggles agree with the report bit for bit. So the inserted
# block holds the APPLIANCE's vane and fan, and the map's own positions do not read them here.
#
# ⛔ It also falsifies the PER-TOWER explanation those two positions were withdrawn under -- using
# the very document that withdrew them. A per-tower register cannot read the appliance value: the
# towers are published in the same record as 3 / 5 and 0 / 0, and the wire reads 1 and 2.
#
# So the relation above holds on this family for words 1..3 as WORDS -- the setpoint, the mode and
# the whole boolean block land at report w20/w21/w22 -- and fails for exactly two bit-fields inside
# the first two of them. The five toggles keep their support regardless, having been confirmed 6/6
# against that fresh record rather than by arithmetic alone.
#
# ⚠️ What is NOT established is which way that failure runs: whether the appliance ignores those
# bits in the group-set, or accepts them and reports the result only in the inserted block. Only a
# write observes that, which is why these two ship as a control the reporter can now verify himself
# -- the readback is restored, so setting the fan from Home Assistant and watching w26.b9 follow is
# the whole test. `windDirectionHorizontal` stays out until this family reads one back.

# The "extended-46" family: a 58-word report (209 B) that is the **extended-36 layout with a ten-word
# block inserted around word 25**. The climate block at words 20..22 sits exactly where extended-36
# puts it, and every attribute from extended-36's word 25 upward is found ten words later. The
# inserted block was taken for a dual-airflow cabinet's second set of fan and vane attributes, which
# these units' device models do declare; a single-flow unit leaves most of it at zero.
#
# ⚠️ That reading is WRONG for the two words we read from it. The block's w25 and w26 carry the
# APPLIANCE's vane and fan, not a tower's: on a report whose cloud record was fresh, they read 2 and
# 1, while the same record published `windDirectionVerticalL`/`R` as 0 / 0 and `windSpeedL`/`R` as
# 3 / 5. Whatever the other eight words are, those two are not per-tower.
#
# ⚠️ **Where the block BEGINS is not pinned, and it matters for anything read from words 23..24.**
# The captures confirm w20/w21/w22 unmoved, w35/w36 at +10, and a vane at w25 with the fan speed at
# w26.b9 inside the block — so it starts after w22 and at or before w25, i.e. at w23, w24 or w25.
# Every one of those predicts indoor temperature at w35, so that cannot separate them, and w23, w24,
# w33 and w34 all read zero in every capture. Anything mapped into that gap would be a guess: the
# flag word carrying `selfCleaningStatus` lands at report w24 under one reading and w34 under the
# other two, which is why this family gets no self-clean field. A single capture with any flag-word
# feature switched on (health, ambient light, fresh air) pins it.
#
# Because the report begins with that media module, the classic partial decode misfires here exactly
# as it does on extended-36: byte 92 is the module's `volume` (100), which reads as a 48 C setpoint,
# and the classic power bit lands in an unrelated word so the unit always looks off.
#
# Three positions differ from extended-36 in kind rather than place, and each is fixed by the values
# the reports themselves carry:
#   * `targetTemperature` is **°C × 2**, not °C − 16 (its device model declares whole-degree steps,
#     so the extra bit of resolution is unused, but the encoding is halves).
#   * `current_temperature` is likewise a half-degree count, as on the classic family.
#   * the vertical vane answers at word 25 — inside the inserted block — where the classic vane
#     encoding still applies (the "swinging" flag is bit 3 of the nibble).
#
# Deliberately omitted from the READ: horizontal swing, and the air-quality/humidity attributes.
# `windSpeed` WAS omitted, on the grounds that this family reports a code its own device model does
# not declare — true of the map's position (a constant 6) and not of the appliance, which answers at
# w26.b9 with codes its model does declare. See the field below.
# Also left out: the cumulative-energy register at words 44+45, which works on this family (unlike
# the classic one, where it reads zero). The register is now known to count watt-hours on
# extended-36, and it is the same published attribute here — but this is the one family that has
# been caught departing from the published map three times over, and its counter's position is
# itself derived from the inserted block. Inheriting an unverified unit into somebody's energy
# history is not a thing to do on the strength of a map this family already disagrees with. One
# reading off the owner's app, against a capture, settles it the same way it was settled there.
# This family is NOT built from the published map, and deliberately: its vane sits five words past
# where the map puts it, its setpoint counts half degrees rather than whole degrees offset by 16,
# and its fan speed answers from the inserted block. Written out, those read as what they are —
# a family with three exceptions — where a displacement plus three overrides would read as a rule
# with more exceptions than rule.

    """Rank plausible layouts for a report no registry entry claims — the first step in adding a
    model, done from the reports themselves rather than by hand.

    Every layout met so far is a known family whose fields are displaced from some word onward, so
    the search is over ``(family, pivot, shift, setpoint encoding)``: try each family with its fields
    at or above each ``pivot`` moved up to ``max_shift`` words later, keep the candidates that decode
    plausibly, and rank them.

    Two things separate a real match from a coincidence, and both matter because a status report is
    mostly zeros — a map whose fields all land on empty words "decodes" into a cold, powered-off unit
    at its minimum setpoint:

    * **Several reports.** Pass every report available (they are captured in different states); a
      candidate must decode *all* of them plausibly, and its score is the weakest one's. A map that
      lands on empty words scores the same in every state, so varied states break the tie.
    * **``shadow``** — the device's own attribute values, from its ``digital_model``, keyed by
      attribute name. A candidate that reproduces values the device published through a different
      channel is almost certainly right.
    * **``order``** — the settings the device declares its group-set carries, in wire order, from
      :func:`~haismart_hrdp.declared_order`. It cannot place anything on its own: displacing every
      field alike preserves the order exactly, so it says nothing about *where* a block starts. What
      it does is reject a **family** that arranges its settings differently: on a real declaration
      it rules out every extended-46 and compact-12 candidate — **375 of 800** — before any of them
      is decoded, and passes every classic and extended-36 one. It prunes the family branch, not the
      offset: the search only moves fields later, so no pivot or shift can violate an ascending
      order. It therefore adds to the stated states rather than replacing them.
    * **``stated``** — what each capture was known to be in, one :class:`StatedState` per report (or
      ``None`` for a capture nobody described). This is the ground truth a new-model report already
      collects: three captures in stated states, plus the room temperature off the handset. It is
      worth as much as the shadow and needs no cloud, so a model can be added from the captures
      alone. Contradicting a stated state costs more than matching one earns.

    Returns up to ``limit`` candidates, best first, each ``{"family", "pivot", "shift", "setpoint",
    "score", "decoded"}``. An empty list means nothing fits, which is itself the useful answer: the
    report is a layout unlike any known family rather than a displaced one.
