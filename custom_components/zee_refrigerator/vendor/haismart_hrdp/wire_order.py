"""Deriving wire positions from the order a device publishes its own group-set in.

A device's constraintfile carries ``groupCommands[].attrNameList`` -- the attributes its group-set
command writes. That list is not arbitrary: it is ordered by **word ascending, then bit descending**,
which is to say it *is* the wire layout, enumerated. Checked against every position we have measured
on real hardware (16 anchors spanning four words): the order matches exactly, with no violations.

Why that matters. A byte map is published only for some models, and a unit whose own identifier is
not among them has no map to look up -- our own units are such a case, and the manufacturer's own
software simply does without a local decode for them. But the constraintfile is fetched *per
device*, and every device has one. So the ordering is available for hardware no map covers, which is
precisely where it is needed.

The order alone does not give positions; widths do that, and a width cannot be read off an
attribute's value range (``targetTemperature`` spans 15 values and occupies 8 wire bits). What the
order does give is a **total ordering constraint**: between two attributes whose positions are known,
every attribute listed between them lies between them on the wire. Anchors come from a bundled
relative or from measurement, and the gaps resolve against them.

Independent check on our own units: the list ends at ``targetRentTime``, and the extra word our
family carries past its nearest bundled relative -- established by experiment, from frame lengths --
is ``targetRentTime`` at w6. The published order predicts it without being told.

    published profiles and matches neither exactly.

    ⚠️ **This is our heuristic, not the manufacturer's.** Their own lookup opens the identifier as a
    filename, once, and gives up: no retry, no alternate name, no nearest match. A device it cannot

    leave, and where the fit is exact there is precisely one way to lay them out.
