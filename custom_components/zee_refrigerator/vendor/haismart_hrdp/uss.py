"""uSS local transport (TCP :56800) — the on-LAN protocol these ACs speak for reads and control.

Layers
------
1. **uSS message**: a 16-byte header + payload::

     [0:4]   info_code BE32 = 0xEA60 + info_type   (hello=0, hello_resp=1, hello_done=2, done_resp=3)
     [4:6]   payload_len + 0x0a (BE16)
     [6]     protocol version (pro_ver 2 -> 0x01, pro_ver 3 -> 0x6E)
     [7]     flag        (0 plaintext / 1 encrypted biz-data)
     [8:12]  sn BE32     (client counter from 1; the AC echoes it)
     [12:14] code2 BE16  (0 for hello)
     [14:16] session BE16 (0 in the client hello; the AC ASSIGNS one in HELLO_RESP)

2. **Handshake** (plaintext): client HELLO → AC HELLO_RESP(+session) → client HELLO_DONE →
   AC HELLO_DONE_RESP. Then the AC push-notifies status as ``0xEAC4`` messages.

3. **biz-data payload**: AES-128-CBC, IV = 16 zero bytes, key = ``MD5(localKey-as-ascii-hex)``. The
   plaintext carries an ``sn`` and an MD5 integrity checksum (verified on decrypt).

# these, and listing a field there is emphatically NOT grounds to add it here.

# Where a field sits, on the other hand, is taken from the published map rather than transcribed by

# place removes the only thing a second copy could contribute: a typo in the table that decides which

    ``layout`` marker (the family name) and ``writable`` flag; the classic family sets neither. Only if
    no wire model claims the report does it fall through to the partial / unknown-layout handling.

    Pass an ``AttributeProfile`` (e.g. ``profile_for("AAC1UKZ01")``) to also get normalized ``mode``/
    ``fan_mode`` tokens. ``uplus_id`` (the device-list ``wifiType``) selects a wire model exactly when
