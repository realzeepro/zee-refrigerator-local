"""Per-model attribute profiles — the model-specific ``AttributeProfile`` seam. Selected by the cloud
``product_code`` / ``pid`` (e.g. ``AAC1UKZ01`` / ``PID_AAC1UKZ01``).

The AAC1UKZ01 enums are **authoritative from the device digital model** (the constraintfile the app
downloads at bind time; see :func:`profile_from_device_config`) — operationMode 0=auto/1=cool/2=dry/
6=fan_only (no heat), windSpeed 1=high/2=medium/3=low/5=auto, targetTemperature 16-30 step 1. These were
independently cross-checked against a live ``getAttributeMap`` dump + a one-attribute-at-a-time app sweep
on real units, all consistent.

No prior open-source project maps this **encrypted uSS/CAE transport** — that part is original here.
⚠️ The *inner* frame is not original and must not be described as unrelated: it is the same
documented ``FF FF`` frame the public Haier implementations speak, and one of the families decoded
here is that protocol exactly, agreeing position for position with a public implementation of it.
What differs is the outer envelope and its encryption, not the frame inside.
