"""The user-facing boolean features an air conditioner may expose, beyond the dozen a family map
names by hand.

Each is an attribute a device's digital model may declare as a **group-set-writable boolean**
(``writeType=G``, a ``false``/``true`` code list) -- the optional comfort and air-treatment
functions a unit either has or does not. This module surfaces them **read-only**: a device that
declares one has the feature, its position comes from :mod:`haismart_hrdp.canonical_map`, and its
value is the bit at that position -- no capture per attribute. Writing them is a separate matter (a
group-set applies the whole word block, so a write needs its own confirmation); this is observability
only.

The set is deliberately the ones NOT already surfaced as dedicated controls (health, strong, quiet,
sleep, lamp, eco, self-clean) -- those keep their hand-built entities.
