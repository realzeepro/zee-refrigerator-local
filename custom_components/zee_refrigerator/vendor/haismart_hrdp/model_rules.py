"""Published model rules for every AC the region publishes, shipped rather than fetched.

The rules a unit is governed by -- which controls lock when, what a fault code is called, which
writes drag siblings along -- are published per model. Fetching them needs an account, and an
account answers only for its *own* devices, so an install with no cloud credentials, or a bug report
about hardware nobody here owns, got nothing and the lock/co-command machinery sat inert. This
bundle removes that dependency for the 171 published air conditioners.

**Keyed by product code, because rules are a property of the product, not of the family.** That is
worth stating because the obvious alternative is wrong: uPlusId is what a unit announces on the LAN
without a key, so keying on it would be far more convenient. But it does not hold. Of the twelve
uPlusId families here, five contain members whose rule sets differ, and in the family our own units
belong to -- 23 products -- **not one modifier is common to all of them**. Keying rules by uPlusId
would hand a device a sibling's rulebook, which is the same defect that once let a two-model account
give one AC the other's constraints.

So :func:`products_for_uplus_id` narrows, and does not decide. A uPlusId identifies the family; the
caller supplies the product code, or asks. What a uPlusId *does* key reliably is the byte map -- see
:mod:`haismart_hrdp.wire_order` -- because layout is shared across a family where rules are not.

    guess* and *applying only what holds whichever model it turns out to be*.

    code -- arrive very nearly in full with no model at all, while conditional availability thins
    out, and thinning out is safe: a rule nobody disagrees about cannot lock the wrong control, and a
    missing rule locks nothing.

    ⚠️ Those first two figures were **100%** when this bundle held one region's 171 products, and

    is marked invisible here. Optional-feature entities are built from that flag, and offering a
    control for hardware a unit does not have is the one failure mode this layer exists to prevent.
